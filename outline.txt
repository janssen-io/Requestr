dotnet api
vue/angular frontend

step 1:
- 2FA login (if not possible, dont make this)
- on first login ask for API key --> oauth if 'public' web app.
-  -> where to save context; appname.d/username.config?
- if restore session fails, request new API key.
- use JWT?

- only one active user possible currently because of singleton BunqContext
  Temporary fix: lock certain endpoints until user is logged out. (not scalable)

api endpoint:
- get accounts
- get transactions; fromDate upToDate accounts
- initialize payment request; transactions
- create payment request; addPdf:bool, addAttachmentDownload:bool, fromEmail, toEmail, toPhone, transactions (stateless)

views:
- login / register
- select transactions
- send payment request
- download attachments

(must have)
!register / login -> 
  return token + isInitialized
if !initialized
!  show api key field

!show transaction list (hold onto previousPageId)
!on scroll pass previous page (should have)
check transactions to be included
press next
fill in e-mail, check with statement (or not) (should have)
if with receipts is checked, phone number is mandatory (nice to have)
!click send (nice to have: confirm e-mail and description)

(nice to have)
back end: download receipts and save to zip ({request-id}.zip)
endpoint /api/receipts/{request-id}: download zip
