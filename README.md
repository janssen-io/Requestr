## Features

- Automatically sum amount by selecting payments
- Send Bunq payment request link via e-mail
- Add multiple recipients
- Add a csv-file of selected payments as attachment

## Technologies

- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
- [.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/)
- [Mailjet](https://www.mailjet.com/)
- [Bunq SDK](https://github.com/bunq/sdk_csharp)

## Installation
**Warning**: I do not recommend you to install this for others to use. The API key that this app uses gives access to all API endpoints of Bunq. Users should never trust any third party with this.

_Further installation notes are still to be written..._
